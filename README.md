# BallAndBeam_Servo
Will be a physics demo called ball and beam when it is finished.

Currently uses ADC to read a pot and set the OCR register which encodes the position of the servo.
A major obstacle of this project is to get real-time position and velocity information of the ball.

Next steps will be a port to a new MCU which can either detect and track the ball or communicate with a program running on the desktop which will do the work.
